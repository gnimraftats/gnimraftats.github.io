	<h1>Roman's Coding Expertise</h1>
	<div class="bigpara">
	  <p>I have been coding (on and off) for about 4 years now. I haven't done any major projects yet. I want to do more but I still lack the confidence to fully dive in. I am a Computer Science major, and from that I have a learned a few programming languages like Java and Python. While I am not an "expert" in either, I understand how the languages work, and can complete given tasks with confidence. I hope to start expanding my coding portfolio with some personal projects. When I do, expect more information on this website!</p>
