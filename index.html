		<p>I've been using computers since I was a kid. Despite this, I'm just now learning to code! Better late than never, right?
		  I started with the AP Comp Sci classes at my high school, and now I'm a comp sci major. To learn more about what I know, click the link below!</p>

		<p>Now editing IS something I  have been doing since I was a kid. I loved YouTube and the idea of individuals being able
		  to make their own videos, so I decided I would make videos, too! Since then I've worked for many different YouTubers and even 
		  made a couple of my own channels!</p>

		<p>I graduated in 2023 with honors. I was a part of the Mock Trial, band, and tennis team. I took 7 AP classes and passed all of them. Sometimes I wonder what happened to that work ethic... My favorite class was Calc 2, though I wouldn't have told you that in the moment!</p>

		<p>Lighting design was never my first choice of occupation, but in hindsight it was a pretty cool one! I've been setting up weddings and events for about four years now. It can be very stressful, but as you can see from the video, it's all worth it in the end!</p>
